# CFPL - Cricket Fantasy premier League  
## Installation
- Jupyter Notebook `pip install jupyterlab`  

## Project Motivation  
With more and more platforms emerging for the users to setup their own cricket teams and win prizes/ cash money (or just to play among friends), there is a growing need for an intelligent system that assists in choosing the right team for maximising league points. This ML based system uses data from IPL 2008-2019 to help improve winning chances by optimising quality/cost ratio.
